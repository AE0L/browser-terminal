# Browser Terminal

A terminal built with **Vanilla JavaScript**. Can run on most modern browsers (I plan to use Babel to add cross-browser compatibility) and has some basic commands that you can find on real machine terminals (e.g. clear, echo, restart).



## Installing

You can run the terminal by cloning it on your machine

```

```

Run the `index.html` file on your browser (I recommend using [**Microsoft Edge: Beta Channel**](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/download), because its the browser that I use. I suggest using modern browsers like Chrome and Firefox to avoid cross-browser compatibilities.



To see a list of built-in commands type `help`.
